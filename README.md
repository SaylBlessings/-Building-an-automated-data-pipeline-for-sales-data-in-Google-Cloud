# -Building-an-automated-data-pipeline-for-sales-data-in-Google-Cloud

Welcome to the project on building an automated data pipeline for sales data using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In this project, I'll guide you through the entire process of setting up a robust data pipeline that facilitates the seamless upload, storage, processing, and visualization of sales data.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of several GCP services to create an efficient and automated data pipeline for sales data. I'll show you how to:

Develop a web portal using Python Flask for uploading sales data files (CSV, Excel).
Store the uploaded files in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.
Trigger a Google Cloud Function to process and load the data into BigQuery.
Use Looker Studio to create insightful dashboards and reports for data visualization.
